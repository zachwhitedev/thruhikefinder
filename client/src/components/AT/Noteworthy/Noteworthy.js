      <h4>Civil War History</h4>
        <p>For history nerds who love to hike, the Appalachian Trail is tough to beat. Not only are the Appalachian mountains older than their western counterparts, the parts of the U.S. that the AT passes are older as well. This makes for a trail that is a true treasure for adventurers who take pleasure in considering all that has come before. The trail crosses the original frontier of colonial America, passes through Civil War battlefields and historic sites like Harper’s Ferry, and traces the journey of runaway slaves who took to the mountains to flee the South along the Underground Railroad.</p>
      <h4>Mooning the Cog</h4>
        <p>In the White Mountains of New Hampshire, the AT takes you to the top of the highest peak in the Northeast: Mount Washington (6,288 feet). However, hiking is not the only way to get to the top of this legendary mountain - not only is there a road that you can take to the top by car, there is also a tiny train for tourists, “The Cog Railway,” that will transport you by track.</p>
        <p>The Cog is seen by most as a fun way to get to the top without having to take the whole day to hike it - especially for senior citizens and the disabled. For many thru-hikers, however, who not only hike the mountain in its entirety, but have walked nearly two thousand miles just to get to it, to be able-bodied and ride "the Cog" to the top is a borderline insult.
        </p>
        <p>Though it is not truly personal and all in good fun (at least for the hikers), it has become a decades-long tradition to turn around, drop your shorts, and “moon the Cog” as it passes over the trail near the top of the mountain. However, we do not recommend you join in - several hikers have been arrested over the years as undercover police occasionally board the train.</p>
